A Solar System simulator which was designed using ChatGPTo3. It uses a Logitech Extreme 3D pro joystick
though probably most joysticks will work. Programmed in vpython. Don't forget to add the surace textures for
the Sun,Moon,Earth,Mercury,Venus,Mars,Jupiter and Saturn. add the various .jpg files in the same program directory as the main program.
 I haven't done past Saturn as I ran into problems fitting it all on.

Good enough to get a good idea. Isn't exact scaling of course as Sun would be too big but gives a visual illustration.

The program will run when you execute it on your default web browser.
